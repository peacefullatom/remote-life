Among many perks of a remote lifestyle, there is one that fits many - you can be a digital nomad.

If you are a part of a distributed team and have a dream to explore the world, then it is an awesome combination!

This set of opportunities will allow you to:
- Seek inspiration.
- Meet new people.
- Learn new languages.
- Attend conferences.
- Explore the world!

And it doesn't matter which is your role in the team: chief, developer, public relations, designer, representative of any kind, etc.

If your activities are bound to some sophisticated set of equipment that you're unable to carry around, you still can spend part of your time as a nomad.

And it also will include everything from the above list.

The important thing is that your time is under your control.

> Explore the world - express yourself!
